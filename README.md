# Walsh and Lynch. Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits

Notes + some simulations to help understand the book.

All of the chapter notes together: [in html](notes/_book/index.html), [in pdf](notes/\_book/quant_genetics_book_notes.pdf). pdf format is viewable in github.

Individual chapters can be found in [notes/\_book/](notes/_book)

To use these notes in full, you'll need a copy of the book with you as well because it references various plots and equations I couldn't be assed to write out.
