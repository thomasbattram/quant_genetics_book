# Walsh and Lynch. Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits

Notes + some simulations to help understand the book.

All of the chapter notes together can be found in notes/\_book/quant_genetics_book_notes.pdf OR in notes/\_book/index.html.

Individual chapters can be found in notes/\_book/

To use these notes in full, you'll need a copy of the book with you as well because it references various plots and equations I couldn't be assed to write out. 

## To-do

* Go back through chapters 3 & 4 and run simulations to help understand each of the concepts. 

* Start referencing equations in the text using the bookdown syntax!
